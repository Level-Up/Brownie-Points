This little hack was done by [Aaron](http://twitter.com/aaronbassett) & [Level Up](http://www.thisislevelup.com). We're Python/Django developers based in Glasgow, Scotland. When we're not mucking about with other people's APIs we build web apps for folks. [Drop us a line](mailto:hello@thisislevelup.com) if you have a project you'd like to talk about.
